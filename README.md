# Forgery-Detection-using-Image-Processing-Techniques
This project Analyzed a sophisticated digital forensics tool to detect copy-move forgery in images using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), enhancing the integrity of digital media The  proposed approach involves converting the color image into a grayscale format,  dividing it into overlapping blocks, and performing feature extraction using DCT  on different feature sets.
